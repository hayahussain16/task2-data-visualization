# Sales, Customer, and Payment Insights 

This document gives you a simple overview of what's shown in the "Sales, Customer, and Payment Insights" dashboard.

## What's in this Dashboard?

This dashboard helps us understand how well the business is doing by looking at:

* Sales: How much stuff we're selling.
* Customers: Who is buying our stuff.
* Payments: How customers are paying us.

## Important Numbers

Here are some of the key numbers at a glance:

* Total Sales: We've sold 6.49M worth of products.
* Total Profit: After subtracting costs, we've made 0.5M in profit.
* Total Sales Revenue: The total money we've received from sales is 5.02M.
* Total Discount: We've given discounts totaling 152.39.
* Profit Margin: For every sale, we're making about 1.29 in profit (this is a ratio).

## What the Charts Show

The dashboard uses charts to help us see trends and compare different things:

* Sales Over Time: One chart shows how sales change month by month, from January to December. This helps us see if sales are going up or down during the year.
* Sales by Product: Another chart compares sales for different types of products, like Clothing, Furniture, Electronics, and Food. This shows us which products are selling the best.
* Sales by Region: A map shows where our sales are coming from, specifically highlighting North America and Europe.
* Sales by Salesperson: A chart compares how much each salesperson (like Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, and Eve) has sold. This helps us see who our top performers are.

## Understanding Customers and Payments

The dashboard also breaks down information about our customers and how they pay:

* Customer Type: We look at sales from "Returning" customers (people who've bought from us before) and "New" customers. This helps us understand if we're keeping our customers happy and attracting new ones.
* Payment Method: We see how customers are paying, such as by "Credit Card," "Bank Transfer," or "Cash." We also look at the profit we make from each payment method.

## Tables with Numbers

There are also tables that give us the exact numbers:

* **Product Sales Numbers:** One table shows the number of different products ("Count of Product\_ID") we sell in each category (Clothing, Furniture, etc.) and the total sales revenue for each category.



This dashboard is a tool to help us make better business decisions by understanding our sales, customers, and payments!
